We use cookies/SDKs for core functionality, analytics, and (optional) marketing.

You can access, correct, or delete your data and opt out of marketing at any time.

We keep data only as long as necessary and protect it with appropriate security measures.

Legal compliance: comply with applicable laws, tax/financial reporting, and enforce our Terms of Use.

4) Legal bases (where applicable)

If you are in the EEA/UK or another jurisdiction that requires a legal basis, we process your personal information on the basis of contract (to provide the Services), legitimate interests (e.g., security, improvement), consent (e.g., marketing, certain cookies), and legal obligation (e.g., tax and accounting).

5) Cookies and similar technologies

We use:

Essential cookies/SDKs for sign-in, cart, checkout, and security (cannot be disabled).

Analytics (e.g., Firebase/Google Analytics) to understand engagement and improve features.

Marketing (e.g., attribution/retargeting) to measure campaigns and show relevant offers (used with consent where required).
You can control cookies in your browser/device settings and via our in-app preferences (where available).

6) How we share information

We do not sell your personal information. We share it with:

Service providers / processors: hosting, cloud storage, analytics, customer support tools, fraud prevention, email/SMS/push delivery, and app performance.

Payment partners: to process payments, prevent fraud, and handle disputes.

Logistics partners: couriers and fulfillment centers to deliver orders and handle returns.

Marketing/analytics partners: to measure performance and (with consent) deliver offers.

Affiliates: companies under common control that help operate the Services.

Legal & safety: to comply with law, enforce terms, protect rights, property, users, or the public.

Business transfers: in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction.

7) International transfers

Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than where you live. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) to protect your information.

8) Retention

We retain personal information only as long as needed for the purposes above, including to comply with legal, accounting, or reporting obligations. For example:

Orders & invoices: retained per tax/accounting laws (often 5–7+ years).

Support communications: retained for quality assurance and dispute handling.

Marketing data: retained until you opt out or delete your account.
When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize the data.

Region-specific rights (summary)

EEA/UK (GDPR): rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict/oppose processing, data portability, and withdraw consent. You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

California (CCPA/CPRA): rights to know, delete, correct, and opt out of “selling”/“sharing” personal information; right to non-discrimination for exercising rights. We do not knowingly sell personal information; if we “share” for cross-context behavioral advertising, you may opt out via our preferences link.

Other regions: you may have similar rights under local law. Contact us to exercise them.

To make a request, email [privacy@[yourdomain].com] and include your account email, the right you want to exercise, and your country/region. We may take steps to verify your identity.

10) Security

We implement technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk, including encryption in transit, access controls, and security monitoring. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

11) Children’s privacy

The Services are not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 (or the age required by your local law, e.g., 16 in some countries). If you believe a child provided us information, contact us to delete it.

12) Third-party services and links

Our Services may contain links to third-party sites or integrate third-party SDKs (payments, analytics, login). Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies. We encourage you to review them.

13) Do Not Track

Some browsers send “Do Not Track” signals. Because there is no industry consensus, we do not respond to these signals. We will honor legally required opt-out mechanisms where applicable.

14) Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you (e.g., by in-app notice or email) and indicate the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Services means you accept the updated policy.
